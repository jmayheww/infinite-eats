## Project Philosophy

At Infinite Eats, we understand the challenges of managing stock and inventory, whether it's for a private individual household or within the fast-paced food service industry. That's why we've developed a platform that aims to streamline and ease the burden of tracking "fridge" inventory. With access to real-time fridge inventory tracking and a robust ordering system, Infinite Eats empowers users to take control of their inventory management like never before.

Our goal is to provide a seamless and efficient solution that allows users to effortlessly track their inventory, ensuring that they never run out of essential items. With our future updates, we're working towards enabling users to customize and automate the restocking and vendor ordering process based on individualized parameters.

## General User Experience

Users can order their preferred products, update their fridge inventory in real-time, and set up automated or custom orders for restocking their "fridges". A secure checkout process is provided via Stripe, ensuring a safe and reliable shopping experience.
